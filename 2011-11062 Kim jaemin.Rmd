##CODE

```{r}
y<-airquality$Wind
x<-airquality$Ozone
res<-lm(y~x)
```

##Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(res)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
